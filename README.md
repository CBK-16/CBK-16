### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**CBK-16/CBK-16** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Chad Kinnard. I am a student at Austin Peay State University, and am set to graduate in August of 2022. My github profile is a little bare right now,
mainly consisting of school projects, but I expect to throw some personal projects soon.
